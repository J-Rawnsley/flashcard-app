            <p>The Flashcard Hint Generator is a time-saving app for English language learners who use flashcards (either paper flashcards or flashcard software such as Anki or Brainscape) to remember words and spellings. When you learn a new word, and you want to remember that word, you can make a flashcard with the word on one side and a hint on the other. You can train your memory by looking at the hint and trying to recall the word. It can take time to find or produce a suitable hint for every new word you want to learn. This app does that for you, to  save you time and help you learn more words! The app works in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Type as many  words as you like into the box, separated by spaces. The app will produce a list of words and a hint for each word, which you can copy and paste into your favourite flashcard app.</li>
                <li>Type a single word into the box. In this case, the hint generator will give you a selection of different hints for that word, so you can choose your favourite (note that some words have only one hint available).</li>
            </ol>    
            <p>The hints are generated using <a href="https://www.wordsapi.com/">Words API</a></p>
